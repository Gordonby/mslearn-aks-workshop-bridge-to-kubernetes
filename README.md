# Bridge to Kubernetes - AKS Workshop sample app

The AKS Workshop lab on the Microsoft Learn platform uses a sample application to help get you up to speed on AKS.  We're going to use that same application to test out Bridge to Kubernetes, to debug our API locally whilst connected to the broader application deployed in AKS.

## Prerequisites
1. The Azure CloudShell in Bash mode
1. Visual Studio code on your development workstation

## Lets get an AKS cluster
If you don't already have one, you can create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with this command;

## Deploying the application to Kubernetes
Glossing over the nuances of the application, we just want to get it deployed and running in super-quick time.  So run this script which will deploy the Ratings API, the Web Application and the Mongo database.
